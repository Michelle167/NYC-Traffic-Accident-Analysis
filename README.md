# NYC Traffic Accidents Analysis 
## **Overview**
This project analyzes NYC Accidents records sourced from Kaggle, focusing on accident volume, geographic distribution, temporal trends, vehicle involvement, street hotspots, causes of collision, and road users affected. The goal is to uncover patterns, highlight risk factors, and provide actionable recommendations for improving road safety.

## **Dataset & Preprocessing**
### **Dataset Source**
- Based on NYC Accidents records.
- Obtained from Kaggle: [Global Traffic Accidents Dataset - NYC_Accidents.csv.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/global-traffic-accidents-dataset?select=NYC_Accidents.csv)

- Contains:
- Date & time of crash
- Borough and street location
- Contributing factors (causes of collision)
- Vehicle types involved
- Road users affected
- Injury and fatality counts
## **Preprocessing Steps**
- **Handling Missing**-  Values → Replaced missing boroughs/streets with “Unspecified.”
- Standardizing Categories → Unified vehicle type names.
- **Date & Time Formatting** → Converted timestamps into Month, Day of Week, Time of Day.
- **Aggregation** → Grouped accident counts by borough, street, month, and vehicle type.
- **Derived Metrics** → Calculated totals for injuries, fatalities, and percentages of road users affected.
- **Filter Creation** → Built filters for Crash Day and Time of Day.
## **Data Flow into Power BI**
- **Raw Data Import** → Accident dataset loaded into Power BI.
- **Transformations** → Applied Power Query steps for cleaning and formatting.
- **Modeling** → Dataset kept as a single table (no relationships created).
- **Visualizations** → Built charts, KPIs, and filters to highlight key findings.
